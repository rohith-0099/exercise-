Music Stream Web Interface
This project provides a sleek, responsive web interface for a music streaming service, heavily inspired by the popular Spotify application. It features a dark theme, intuitive navigation, and a persistent music player, aiming to offer a familiar and engaging user experience.

‚ú® Features
Spotify-like Dark Theme: A visually appealing interface with a black and dark grey color palette, accented by a vibrant green for interactive elements, designed to reduce eye strain.

Responsive Layout: The interface adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The sidebar collapses on smaller screens, replaced by a mobile navigation bar at the bottom.

Intuitive Sidebar Navigation:

Home: A personalized feed displaying "Good evening" greetings, "Recently played" tracks, and "Made for you" playlists.

Search: A dedicated section with a prominent search bar and various music categories to browse.

Your Library: Organizes playlists, artists, albums, and podcasts, with filtering options.

Playlist Management: Quick links to create new playlists and access "Liked Songs."

Dynamic Content Area: The main section of the application dynamically loads content based on the selected navigation item or playlist, providing a fluid browsing experience.

Persistent Music Player Bar: A sticky bar at the bottom of the screen that remains visible during navigation, featuring:

Current album art, song title, and artist.

Playback controls (play/pause, previous, next, shuffle, repeat).

Interactive progress bar for seeking through songs.

Volume control slider.

Interactive UI Elements: Subtle hover effects on cards and buttons, along with smooth transitions, enhance the user's interaction with the interface.

Font Awesome Icons: Used throughout the application for clear and consistent iconography.

Mock Data: The interface is populated with placeholder album art, song titles, artist names, and playlist data to demonstrate functionality and provide a realistic feel.
